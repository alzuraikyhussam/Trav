## 🔧 Configuration

### API Configuration
Update API endpoints in `lib/app/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-api-domain.com';
```

### App Configuration
- **App Name**: Modify in `pubspec.yaml` and splash screen
- **Colors**: Update `lib/app/core/constants/app_colors.dart`
- **Animations**: Adjust durations in `app_constants.dart`

## 🧪 Testing

The project is structured for easy testing:
- **Unit Tests**: For controllers and services

- **Integration Tests**: For complete user flows

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Controllers are lazily initialized
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and resources
- **Image Caching**: Using cached_network_image for efficient image loading
